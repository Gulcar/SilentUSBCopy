# SilentUSBCopy
This program will silently copy files from any usb that is inserted into the pc.     
Tested and should be working on Windows.   
To build just open the SilentUSBCopy.sln in Visual Studio (I used VS2022) and build the project.    
To use double click on the SilentUSBCopy.exe created in the folder bin/Debug/net6.0/     
The .exe will open a command line and will be ready to copy an USB.    
All the files this program copies will be stored next to the .exe in folder "files".
